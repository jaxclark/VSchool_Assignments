        <p class="frontPage"><b>BEAVERTON, OR</b>—Warning customers to return the garments should they find themselves being drained of all fluids, Nike recalled thousands of sweat-wicking shirts Tuesday that inadvertently pulled gallons of liquid directly from wearers’ bodies. “If you or anyone you know puts on a Legend Dri-FIT short-sleeve training shirt and then immediately shrivels into a dried, wrinkled husk, please contact Nike for a full refund,” said spokeswoman Jessica Garland, who apologized directly to customers who purchased a moisture-wicking shirt, only to have every ounce of sweat, urine, and blood sucked out of their body. “You may think it’s okay to wear these shirts for a routine workout at the gym, <u>but be warned</u>—after five minutes of use, you could lose up to 40 pounds of water weight. Even if you wear it to sleep, you could wake up as nothing but a pile of desiccated flesh lying in a puddle.” At press time, Nike was forced to issue a second apology after news broke of a million-dollar lawsuit alleging their compression tops had crushed the torsos of athletes into an infinitesimally small speck of dust.</p>

        <p><b>SEATTLE</b>—In a stern company-wide email sent to its more than 650,000 employees worldwide, Amazon reportedly issued a reminder Wednesday that the company expressly forbids bringing outside thoughts into the workplace. “This policy is stated clearly in our employee manual and posted prominently in every breakroom, but once more we find it necessary to reiterate that when you step onto company premises, you are required to leave behind any ideas, beliefs, or sentiments not provided to you by Amazon,” senior vice president Jeffrey M. Blackburn wrote in the email, adding that if the current situation does not improve, he will be forced to instruct company security to conduct random interrogations of employees during the workday to ensure full compliance with the rule. “From the moment your shift begins until the moment it ends, you must not engage with or give voice to any unauthorized opinions or concerns that may arise in your conscious mind. In addition, though what you do on your own time is of course up to you, we would prefer you also keep personal thoughts to a minimum at home and never gather with your coworkers in groups of two or more after hours. Trust us—this is for your own good.” <mark>Sources also confirmed that Amazon warehouse managers have been given permission to issue suspensions to any employees caught having daydreams while on lunch or bathroom breaks.</mark></p>

        <p><b>LOS ANGELES</b>—Recalling the character’s unanticipated popularity with viewers, producers of the hit ’90s TV series Seinfeld told reporters Thursday that in the original version of the show’s pilot, Jerry is the victim of a grisly murder. “The death of this minor character 10 minutes into the first episode was supposed to be the inciting incident that brings together this quirky group of friends who all meet up at his funeral,” said series executive producer George Shapiro, adding that test audiences greatly enjoyed the rapport between the character and his neighbor, Kramer, but responded negatively when Jerry was brutally gunned down in a diner on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. “As it turned out, viewers really liked Jerry’s clever observations about human nature and the sarcastic remarks he made in reaction to his friends’ many foibles, so we decided to give the character a greatly expanded role. Once the writers discovered the actor who played Jerry also performed stand-up, it just made sense to incorporate that into the show as well. The rest is television history!” Shapiro went on to note that when the pilot was rewritten, the series became much more of a comedy, moving away from the original concept of a gritty police procedural featuring hard-bitten homicide detective George Costanza.</p>

        <p>Oh, man, gamers have got to take a gander at this new trainwreck. It looks like reviewers across the internet are harping on new RPG Eternal Dragon: Knights Of Terellia, deriding the open-world game’s 5,000 hours of dialogue spread over 200 side quests and six different endings as completely rushed and blandly repetitive.

                Looks like whoever wrote the 1,500-page script for this game’s 16 playable characters has some explaining to do!
                
                The game, which is an open-world exploration title set in a massive fantasy kingdom, is being slammed by players and reviewers alike for the slipshod nature of its writing, which many have complained seems consistently churned out and uninspired over the course of its 250-hour average playtime. It’s a shame that in this day and age, video game writers don’t put a little more care into all of their 150,000 lines of dialogue.
                
                What’s downright embarrassing for the Eternal Dragon developers is that many players have discovered reused lines when talking to one of the games 2,750 NPCs. It’s like these guys don’t even know they’re supposed to be world building! Would it kill them to spend a little more time fleshing out the months of recorded branching conversations that change based on your class and gender?
